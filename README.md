Flexible Navigation
===================

Flexible Navigation is a rework of the ROS Navigation stack into independent modules that
interface with [FlexBE] compatible state implementations.  These allow a user to
graphically chain together states in a state machine to essentially
create their own navigation stack to suit any need.

This allows for supervisory and sliding autonomy within navigation, and better
control over contingencies and recovery behaviors.

The code makes use of the [FlexBE Behavior Engine] and [FlexBE UI].

About
-----

This system provides specific navigation planning and path following
capabilities based on the ROS Navigation [move_base] packages and is compatible
with any base_global_planner and base_local_planner plugin.

A ROS node wrapper for each plugin type provides several ActionLib
interfaces to [FlexBE] state implementations.

Install
-------

A complete demonstration system is provided as part of the CHRISLab [Turtlebot Flexible Navigation] demonstration.
Follow setup and operation directions there for an integrated demonstration.  
The complete system is easily setup and built by following the installation directions at [CHRISLab Install].

The [Turtlebot Flexible Navigation] demonstration uses the SBPL lattice planner in a move_base like planning scheme.  
An alternative demonstration uses a three layer planning scheme to demonstrate the flexibility of the decoupled approach.

The Flexible Navigation system has been tested using the latest version of ROS Noetic.
You should first follow the [ROS Install Guide] and get that set up before proceeding.
